This software is intended to help investors assess the costs of investing on 
Photo-Voltaics technology. Its final output is a set of values in €/kWh as 
function of system lifetime. This provides the investor with a direct 
comparison with the cost of electricity supplied by the grid at the same 
location. Detailed information on the method and the mathematical expressions
used is available at this blog post [0].
